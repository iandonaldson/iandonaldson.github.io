## About 

I specialize in bioinformatics research related to the construction and use of protein interaction maps.   I have over 17 years of experience building and using bioinformatics applications and leading both small and large development teams.

The last release of the iRefIndex database of consolidated protein interactions is freely available at irefindex.org.
